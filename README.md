The Let it Grow Garden Planner is a digital space where data-driven gardeners can plan what to grow and analyze trends that support their gardening goals.

It is a desktop application that runs on Windows using the Python coding language and a SQL back-end database.

This project is currently under development as part of my Software Develepment degree capstone course at Champlain College Online.
